# 3D-Checkers
Repository for my "3D Checkers" Project for my "Computer Graphics" course at Rowan University. The program is written in HTML and JavaScript, and was coded using VS Code.

***To run the program, download all of the files into one place and then double-click on the HTML file. The program runs in Google Chrome.***

Please read the HOW_TO_PLAY.txt file for instructions on how to run the program and play the game as well as the controls.
